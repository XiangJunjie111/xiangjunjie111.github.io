# Topic 6 System Modeling

**System modeling is the process of developing abstract models of a system, with each model presenting a different view or perspective of that system.**

Models of the [existing system] and [new system] are used during requirements engineering.

In a model-driven engineering process, it is possible to generate a complete or partial system implementation from the system model.

**System perspectives**

- **External perspective:** model the context or environment of the system
- **Interaction perspective:** model the interactions between a system and its environment, or between the components of a system.
- **Structural perpective:** model the organization of a system or the structure of the data that is processed by the system.
- **Behavioral perpective:** model dynamic behavior of the system and how it responds to events

**UML diagram types:**

### Context models

- **Context models**: simply show the other systems in the environment.



- **Process models** reveal how the system being developed is used in braoder business processed: use **Activity diagram**

### Interaction models

- **User case modeling**
- **Sequence diagram**

### Structural models

Structural models of software display the organization of a system in terms of the components that make up that system and their relationships.

- **Class diagrams:** are used when developing an object- oriented system model to show the classes in a system and the associations between these classes.

### Behavioral models

Behavioral models are **models of the dynamic behavior** of a system as it is executing. 

They show what happens or what is supposed to happen when a system responds to a **stimulus from its environment**.

**Two types of stimuli**

- Data

- Events: Events may have associated data.

#### Data-dricen modeling

- **Activity model** of the insulin pump's operation

### Model-driven engineering

**定义：**

Model-driven engineering (MDE) is an approach to software development where models rather than programs are the principal outputs of the development process.

**Pros:**

- Allows systems to be considered at higher levels of abstraction

- **Generating code automatically** means that it is cheaper to adapt systems to new platforms.

**Cons:**

- Models for abstraction and not necessarily right for implementation.

- Savings from generating code may be outweighed by the costs of developing translators for **new platforms**.

#### Model driven architecture

**定义：**

Model-driven architecture (MDA) was the precursor of more general model-driven engineering

MDA is a model-focused approach to software design and implementation that uses a subset of UML models to describe a system.

<img src="/Users/项君杰/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20200819221912977.png" alt="image-20200819221912977" style="zoom:50%;" />

**MDA没有成为主流的软件开发方法原因：**

- 有用的抽象对实现而言并不总是正确的抽象
- 对于大多数复杂系统，实现不是主要问题——需求工程、信息安全和可依赖性、遗留系统集成和测试都更为重要
- 追求平台无关性只对大型、长生命周期的系统有意义，因为平台会在系统生命周期过程中逐渐变得过时。
- 在MDA方法发展的同一时期，被广泛采用的Agile成功吸引了开发人员的注意力。

### Key points

- A **model is an abstract view** of a system that ignores system details. Complementary system models can be developed to show the system’s **context, interactions, structure and behavior**.
-  **Context models** show how a system that is being modeled is positioned in an environment with other systems and processes.
- **Use case diagrams** and sequence diagrams are used to describe the interactions between users and systems in the system being designed. Use cases describe interactions between a system and external actors; **sequence diagrams** add more information to these by showing interactions between system objects.
- **Structural models** show the organization and architecture of a system. **Class diagram**s are used to define the static structure of classes in a system and their associations.
- **Behavioral models** are used to describe the dynamic behavior of an executing system. This behavior can be modeled from the perspective of the **data** processed by the system, or by the **events** that stimulate responses from a system.
- **Activity diagrams** may be used to model the **processing of data**, where each activity represents one process step.

- **State diagrams** are used to model a system’s behavior in response to internal or external events.
- **Model-driven engineering** is an approach to software development in which a system is represented as a set of models that can be **automatically transformed to executable code.**
